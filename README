A continuum of Barry Norton's D2Rs LinkedBrainz fork [1] and kurtjx's D2Rs LinkedBrainz fork [3] that includes the slightly modified D2R server [3] (e.g. with additional uuid handling) and the LinkedBrainz [4] related translator classes. The code base is now embedded in a maven [5] project and the dependencies are imported as much as possible over the maven mechanism (excl. D2RQ [6,7] whose dependencies still must be added manually, because they are not available via an online maven repository ATM).
The generated JAR file can be copied in the 'lib' folder of your D2R-LinkedBrainz [1,2] installation (it would probably replace the existing version of the D2RS-LinkeBrainz jar; otherwise you have to remove the existing D2RS-LinkedBrainz jar before). The version of this project will be occasionally pushed to [1] as well.
